A simple web crawler designed to pull HTML pages from a Lord of the Rings wiki.

The crawler takes an argument for a website to crawl, but defaults to
lotr.wikia.com. It ceases crawling links after a set limit is reached. The HTML
from the primary article div is saved in files.

eg. $ python lotr_crawler www.google.com
or $ python lotr_crawler

Please use this wisely. I am not responsible for excess traffic to the wiki.
