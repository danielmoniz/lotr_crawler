A simple web crawler designed to pull HTML pages from a Lord of the Rings wiki.

The crawler takes an argument for a website to crawl, but defaults to
lotr.wikia.com. It ceases crawling links after a set limit is reached. The HTML
from the primary article div is saved in files. The images are savedlocally in the wiki/images/(article-title)/(image-name). The HTML source is then modified to use the local images.

eg. $ python lotr_crawler www.google.com
or $ python lotr_crawler

@TODO Make a check for http errors to ensure the crawler does not halt. Remove 
URL from crawled list if it fails (assuming it has been added already).

This was intended as a learning exercise and not for actual use. Please use this wisely. I am not responsible for excess traffic to the wiki.
